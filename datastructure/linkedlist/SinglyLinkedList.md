Alright, let's break down the complexity analysis of singly and doubly linked lists in a way that even a 13-year-old could understand!

**Imagine a Line of Friends**

Think of a linked list like a line of friends at a party. Each friend is a "node" and they're holding hands (the "pointers").

- **Singly Linked List:** Friends can only hold hands with the person in front of them. To find someone specific, you have to start at the beginning and walk down the line.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Friends can hold hands with the person in front of them _and_ the person behind them. This makes it easier to move both forwards and backwards.

**Let's look at the complexity for common operations:**

**1. Searching (Finding a Friend):**

- **Singly Linked List (O(n)):** You might have to check every friend in the line (n friends) before you find the one you're looking for.
- **Doubly Linked List (O(n)):** It's the same as a singly linked list. You still need to walk through the line to find your friend.

**2. Inserting at the Head (Adding a Friend at the Front):**

- **Singly Linked List (O(1)):** You can easily add a friend at the front of the line by just having them hold hands with the first person. You don't need to move anyone else.
- **Doubly Linked List (O(1)):** Same as a singly linked list. You make the new friend hold hands with the person at the front and the person behind the front.

**3. Inserting at the Tail (Adding a Friend at the End):**

- **Singly Linked List (O(1)):** You need to find the last friend in the line, which could take a long time (O(n)). But once you find them, you can quickly have them hold hands with the new friend.
- **Doubly Linked List (O(1)):** You already know who the last friend is (the tail), so you can just have them hold hands with the new friend.

**4. Removing at the Head (Taking Away the First Friend):**

- **Singly Linked List (O(1)):** You just have to tell the second friend to start holding hands with the first friend's previous hand-holding buddy (if there is one).
- **Doubly Linked List (O(1)):** You have to make the second friend hold hands with the first friend's previous hand-holding buddy and update the head pointer.

**5. Removing at the Tail (Taking Away the Last Friend):**

- **Singly Linked List (O(n)):** You need to find the second-to-last friend in the line (O(n)). Then, you tell them to stop holding hands with the last friend.
- **Doubly Linked List (O(1)):** You already know who the last friend is. You just have to have the second-to-last friend stop holding hands with them.

**6. Removing in the Middle (Taking Away a Friend in the Middle):**

- **Singly Linked List (O(n)):** You need to find the friend you want to remove (O(n)). Then, you have the friend before them hold hands with the friend after them.
- **Doubly Linked List (O(n)):** You still need to find the friend you want to remove (O(n)). But then, you just have to update the pointers on the friends before and after them.

**In summary:**

- Doubly linked lists are generally faster for removing elements at the tail and for removing elements in the middle.
- Singly linked lists are generally faster for inserting elements at the tail.

Let me know if you have any other questions about linked lists!

**Explanation:**

1. **Node Class:**

   - `Node` is an inner class representing a single element in the linked list.
   - `data`: Stores the actual value of the node.
   - `next`: A reference to the next `Node` in the list.

2. **SinglyLinkedList Class:**

   - `head`: A reference to the first `Node` of the list.
   - `constructor`: Initializes the list with `head` set to `null` (empty list).

3. **Methods:**
   - `insertAtHead(int data)`:
     - Creates a new `Node` with the provided `data`.
     - Makes the `next` pointer of the new node point to the current `head`.
     - Updates the `head` reference to the new node, effectively adding the node at the beginning.
   - `insertAtTail(int data)`:
     - Creates a new `Node` with the given `data`.
     - If the list is empty, sets the `head` to the new node.
     - Otherwise, iterates through the list to find the last node.
     - Appends the new node to the end by setting the `next` pointer of the last node to the new node.
   - `delete(int key)`:
     - If the list is empty, does nothing.
     - Checks if the head node has the `key` and updates `head` if found.
     - Otherwise, iterates through the list, keeping track of the previous node.
     - If the `key` is found, updates the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the current node, effectively deleting it.
   - `printList()`:
     - Iterates through the list, printing each node's `data` and an arrow (`->`).
     - Prints "null" to mark the end of the list.

**How it Works (Example):**

1. **Creating the List:**

   - `list.insertAtHead(10)`: Adds 10 at the beginning.
   - `list.insertAtTail(20)`: Adds 20 at the end.
   - `list.insertAtHead(5)`: Adds 5 at the beginning.
   - `list.insertAtTail(30)`: Adds 30 at the end.
   - The list becomes: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null

2. **Deleting a Node:**
   - `list.delete(20)`: Finds the node with data 20, updates the previous node's `next` pointer to skip it.
   - The list becomes: 5 -> 10 -> 30 -> null

**Key Points:**

- Singly linked lists are linear data structures, meaning nodes are connected in a sequence.
- They are dynamic, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion at specific locations.
- They require keeping track of the `head` to access the list.
- Searching for a specific node requires traversing the list sequentially, which can be time-consuming for large lists.

**Explanation of `insertAtPosition(int data, int position)`:**

1. **Handle Invalid Position:**

   - If `position` is less than 1, it's invalid, and an error message is printed.

2. **Insert at Head:**

   - If `position` is 1, it's the same as inserting at the head, so the `insertAtHead` method is used.

3. **Find Insertion Position:**

   - Create a new `Node` with the given `data`.
   - Start at the `head` node and use a `count` variable to track the current position.
   - Iterate through the list until either:
     - `count` is equal to `position - 1` (we've reached the node before the desired insertion point) or
     - `current.next` is `null` (we've reached the end of the list and the position is invalid).

4. **Insert the New Node:**

   - If the insertion position was found:
     - Set the `next` pointer of the new node to the node that was originally at `position`.
     - Set the `next` pointer of the node at `position - 1` to the new node.

5. **Handle Invalid Position:**
   - If the insertion position wasn't found, print an error message indicating that the position exceeds the list size.

**Example:**

- After creating the list: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
- Calling `list.insertAtPosition(15, 3)`:
  - The loop iterates until `count` is 2 (the position before the desired insertion point).
  - The new node with data 15 is inserted between the node with data 10 and the node with data 20.
  - The list becomes: 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 30 -> null

**Key Points:**

- This method allows for flexible insertion at any valid position within the list.
- It efficiently inserts the new node by updating pointers without needing to shift existing nodes.
- Proper error handling ensures that invalid positions are caught and handled appropriately.
