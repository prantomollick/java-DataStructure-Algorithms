Okay, let's break down this code like it's a game! Imagine you have a stack of boxes, but you can only add and remove boxes from the top. This code does the same thing, but with numbers instead of boxes.

**1. Setting Up the Stack:**

- **`public class IntStack implements Stack<Integer>`:** We're making a new type of box stack called "IntStack". It's like saying "This stack is for storing whole numbers."
- **`private int[] arr;`:** We're making a big box that can hold a bunch of numbers. It's like the actual stack of boxes.
- **`private int pos = 0;`:** We're keeping track of where we are in the stack. It's like a pointer showing you the top box.

**2. Creating a New Stack:**

- **`public IntStack(int maxSize)`:** This is like deciding how many boxes our stack can hold. `maxSize` is the number of boxes you can put in.
- **`arr = new int[maxSize];`:** We're creating the box array with enough space to hold `maxSize` boxes.

**3. Checking the Stack:**

- **`public int size()`:** This tells you how many boxes are currently in the stack.
- **`public boolean isEmpty()`:** This tells you if the stack is empty (no boxes).

**4. Looking at the Top Box:**

- **`public Integer peek()`:** This lets you peek at the top box without taking it out. It throws an error if the stack is empty.

**5. Adding a Box:**

- **`public void push(Integer value)`:** This puts a new box on top of the stack. It takes a number (`value`) and adds it to the stack.
- **`arr[pos++] = value;`:** This is like placing the new box on top and moving the pointer up to the next box spot.

**6. Removing a Box:**

- **`public Integer pop()`:** This takes the top box off the stack. It throws an error if the stack is empty.
- **`return arr[--pos];`:** This is like taking the top box off and moving the pointer down to the next box.

**7. Printing the Stack:**

- **`public String toString()`:** This shows you what boxes are in the stack, starting from the bottom.
- **`StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Stack: [");`:** It's like making a new empty box to hold all the numbers.
- **`for (int i = 0; i < pos - 1; i++) { sb.append(arr[i]).append(", "); }`:** This loops through the boxes from the bottom and adds each number to the box.
- **`sb.append(arr[pos-1] + "]");`:** This adds the top number to the box.
- **`return sb.toString();`:** This turns the box into a string you can see.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a stack of boxes that can hold up to 5 boxes. You can push (add) numbers onto the stack and pop (remove) them from the top. Here's how it would work:

1. **`IntStack myStack = new IntStack(5);`** - You create a new stack that can hold up to 5 boxes.
2. **`myStack.push(10);`** - You add the number 10 to the top of the stack.
3. **`myStack.push(20);`** - You add the number 20 to the top, so now 20 is on top of 10.
4. **`myStack.peek();`** - This lets you look at the top number (20) without taking it off.
5. **`myStack.pop();`** - This takes the number 20 off the top of the stack. Now 10 is on top.

This code lets you manage a stack of numbers just like you would manage a stack of boxes!
