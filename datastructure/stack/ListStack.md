Okay, let's break down this Java code step-by-step so a 13-year-old can understand it. Imagine a stack of books on a table:

**Explanation:**

1. **`ListStack<T>`:** This line defines a class named "ListStack". The `<T>` means that this stack can hold any type of data (like numbers, strings, objects, etc.).

2. **`java.util.LinkedList<T> list = new java.util.LinkedList<T>();`:** This creates a "LinkedList" called "list" inside the `ListStack` class. Think of this like a shelf where we can store items.

3. **`public ListStack() {}`:** This is the "constructor." It's like a blueprint for creating a new empty stack.

4. **`public ListStack(T firstElem) { push(firstElem); }`:** This is another constructor, but this time it lets you create a stack with an initial element.

5. **`public int size() { return list.size(); }`:** This method tells you how many items are in the stack (like counting the books on the shelf).

6. **`public boolean isEmpty() { return list.isEmpty(); }`:** This checks if the stack is empty (like if the shelf is empty).

7. **`public void push(T elem) { list.addFirst(elem); }`:** This is like putting a new book on top of the stack. `addFirst` adds the new item at the beginning of the `list`.

8. **`public T pop() { ... }`:** This is like taking the top book off the stack. It removes and returns the element at the top.

9. **`public T peek() { ... }`:** This is like looking at the top book without taking it off the stack. It returns the top element without removing it.

10. **`public int search(T elem) { ... }`:** This searches for an element within the stack, similar to looking for a specific book on the shelf. It returns the position of the element.

11. **`@Override public java.util.Iterator<T> iterator() { return list.iterator(); }`:** This allows you to easily go through all the items in the stack, like looking at each book on the shelf one by one.

**Time Complexity**

- **`push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, `size`:** These methods typically have a time complexity of **O(1)**, meaning they take a constant amount of time, regardless of the number of items in the stack. This is because they directly access the top or bottom of the linked list.

- **`search`:** This method has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the stack. This is because it might have to search through the entire linked list to find the element.

**Example**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ListStack<Integer> myStack = new ListStack<>();

        // Push some numbers onto the stack
        myStack.push(10);
        myStack.push(20);
        myStack.push(30);

        // Peek at the top
        System.out.println("Top element: " + myStack.peek()); // Output: 30

        // Pop the top element
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + myStack.pop()); // Output: 30

        // Check the size
        System.out.println("Stack size: " + myStack.size()); // Output: 2
    }
}
```
