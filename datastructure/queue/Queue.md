This code defines a generic interface called `Queue<T>` in Java. Let's break it down:

**1. Interface Declaration:**

```java
public interface Queue<T> {
```

- `public`: This makes the interface accessible from anywhere within the project.
- `interface`: This keyword declares the interface.
- `Queue<T>`: This is the interface name. The `<T>` indicates that it's a generic interface, meaning it can work with any type of data (represented by the type parameter `T`).

**2. Interface Methods:**

The interface defines several methods:

- `public void offer(T elem);`: This method adds an element (`elem`) to the queue.
- `public T poll();`: This method removes and returns the element at the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns `null`.
- `public T peek();`: This method returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns `null`.
- `public int size();`: This method returns the number of elements in the queue.
- `public boolean isEmpty();`: This method returns `true` if the queue is empty, and `false` otherwise.

**Explanation:**

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** A queue adheres to the FIFO principle. The element added first is the first to be removed.
- **Generic Type:** The `T` parameter lets you create queues that can hold any type of object (e.g., `Queue<String>`, `Queue<Integer>`, `Queue<Customer>`).
- **Interface:** An interface defines a contract, specifying what methods must be implemented by any class that implements the `Queue` interface.

**Example Usage:**

```java
// Create a queue of Strings
Queue<String> stringQueue = new LinkedList<>();

// Add elements to the queue
stringQueue.offer("apple");
stringQueue.offer("banana");
stringQueue.offer("cherry");

// Access and remove elements
String firstFruit = stringQueue.poll(); // firstFruit = "apple"
String nextFruit = stringQueue.peek();  // nextFruit = "banana" (not removed)
```

**Important Notes:**

- You cannot directly instantiate an interface (`Queue<String> stringQueue = new Queue<>();` is invalid). You need to create a class that implements the `Queue` interface and provide implementations for its methods (e.g., `LinkedList`).
- The `Queue` interface doesn't specify how the queue is implemented (e.g., linked list, array). It only defines the expected behavior.

This interface provides a blueprint for creating and working with queues in Java, ensuring consistency across various queue implementations.
