Okay, let's break down the code and explain it in a way a 13-year-old can understand.

**Imagine this:** You're playing a game where you have to keep track of the order of things you get. You can only add things to the back of the line, and you can only take things off from the front. This is like a queue!

**The Code Explained:**

1. **`/** ... \*/`\*\*

   - This is a comment explaining what the code does. It's like a note to remind you what this whole thing is about.

2. **`package com.williamfiset.algorithms.datastructures.queue;`**

   - This tells the computer where to put this code in your project. It's like putting a book on a shelf in your library.

3. **`public class IntQueue implements Queue<Integer> {`**

   - This defines a new type of queue called `IntQueue`. It's like saying, "Hey, I'm making a special kind of queue that only stores numbers (integers)."

4. **`private int[] data;`**

   - This creates a secret storage space for the numbers in the queue. Think of it like a bunch of boxes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3... You put the numbers in these boxes.

5. **`private int front, end;`**

   - These are like pointers. `front` points to the next number you'll take out, and `end` points to where you'll put the next number.

6. **`private int size;`**

   - This keeps track of how many numbers are in the queue, like counting how many people are in line.

7. **`public IntQueue(int maxSize) { ... }`**

   - This is the constructor. It's like setting up the game. You tell it how big the storage space (the boxes) needs to be.

8. **`public boolean isEmpty() { ... }`**

   - This checks if the queue is empty, like checking if the line is empty. It returns `true` if there are no numbers in the queue, and `false` if there are some numbers.

9. **`public int size() { ... }`**

   - This tells you how many numbers are in the queue. It's like counting how many people are in line.

10. **`@Override public Integer peek() { ... }`**

- This lets you look at the number at the front of the queue without taking it out. It's like peeking at the first person in line.

11. **`public boolean isFull() { ... }`**

- This checks if the queue is full, like checking if the line is full. It returns `true` if the queue is full, and `false` if there's still room.

12. **`@Override public void offer(Integer value) { ... }`**

- This adds a new number to the back of the queue. It's like adding a person to the end of the line.

13. **`@Override public Integer poll() { ... }`**

- This takes the number at the front of the queue and removes it. It's like taking the first person out of the line.

14. **`public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`**

- This is where the code actually runs. It's like starting the game. It shows you how to use the queue.

15. **`private static void benchMarkTest() { ... }`**

- This is like comparing your queue to another one to see which is faster. It tests how quickly your queue can add and remove numbers.

**Time Complexity:**

- **`isEmpty()`, `size()`, `peek()`, `isFull()`: O(1)** - These operations take a constant amount of time, no matter how many numbers are in the queue. It's like checking the length of a line.
- **`offer()`, `poll()`: O(1)** - These operations also take a constant amount of time. It's like adding a person to the end of the line or taking the first person out.

**Example (Think of a Line at a Store):**

1. **`IntQueue q = new IntQueue(5);`** - You create a queue that can hold up to 5 people.
2. **`q.offer(1);`** - You put the first person (number 1) in line.
3. **`q.offer(2);`** - You put the second person (number 2) in line.
4. **`q.offer(3);`** - You put the third person (number 3) in line.
5. **`q.offer(4);`** - You put the fourth person (number 4) in line.
6. **`q.offer(5);`** - You put the fifth person (number 5) in line.
7. **`q.poll();`** - The first person (number 1) in line is served and leaves.
8. **`q.poll();`** - The second person (number 2) in line is served and leaves.
9. **`q.poll();`** - The third person (number 3) in line is served and leaves.
10. **`q.poll();`** - The fourth person (number 4) in line is served and leaves.

This queue is super fast because it doesn't have to move any of the people around when you add or remove someone!
